            <h2>Why Tree Planting Matters</h2>
            <p>Our planet faces a number of pressing environmental issues, and one of the most critical is deforestation. The destruction of forests not only leads to habitat loss for countless species but also contributes to climate change. Trees play an essential role in combating global warming, purifying the air, and maintaining biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li class="stat">Each year, we lose around 18 million acres of forest — that’s about 27 soccer fields every minute.</li>
                <li class="stat">Forests absorb approximately 30% of global carbon emissions, helping to mitigate climate change.</li>
                <li class="stat">One mature tree can absorb CO2 at a rate of 48 pounds per year, making trees a natural solution to reducing the carbon footprint.</li>
                <li class="stat">Trees help preserve water cycles, prevent soil erosion, and provide oxygen for living organisms.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Solution: Planting Trees</h2>
            <p>By planting trees, we can make a significant impact on reversing the effects of deforestation. Tree planting contributes to carbon sequestration, restores habitats for wildlife, and helps restore the natural balance of ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Every tree planted counts. It helps mitigate climate change, protect biodiversity, and improve the quality of life for future generations.</p>
